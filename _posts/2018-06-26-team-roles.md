Key software people skill: know your role in team conversations. Are you the task leader this time? Are you the
evaluating audience? Tension reliever? Central negative? Knowing how your contribution functions can help you focus on
effective contribution.

Task lead should lay out a clear description of the problem at hand. Should follow up with suggested course of action,
possibly alternatives & a recommendation. Negotiate over challenges with central negative.

Central negative works on clarifying solutionâ€™s fit to problem space. Interrogates solution. Find corner cases and
scaling concerns. Identify underserved workflows. Best players strengthen solution rather than shoot down: suggest
improvements not just defects.

The back and forth of the task lead and central negative can produce friction. The tension reliever helps drain that
pressure before things get heated. A joke might work for some teams. Tabling contentions might for others. Any redirect
that works, works.

The audience is like oil for the conversation. Aligned with no one, they help assess the points raised and the solutions
offered. They support the tension reliever when redirection is needed. By lending support, they make conversation less
personal.

Often, conversations are dynamic and roles can change. It can be important to know when to yield a role, or assume it.
But knowing your responsibility can help achieve it.

<div class="blurb">
    I'm Geoff Gerrietts. I've worn a variety of hats over the years, from poet to programmer to sysadmin to manager.
    Today the main hats I wear are data pipeline engineer, father, writer, and occasional gamer. I also provide a
    substantial counterweight for my dog to drag around the neighborhood.
